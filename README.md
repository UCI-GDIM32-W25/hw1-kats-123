## Devlog
Prompt: Include the HW1 break-down exercise you wrote during the Week 1 - Lecture 2 (Jan 9) in-class activity (above). If you did not attend and perform this activity, review the lecture slides and write your own plan for how you believe HW1 should be built. If your initially proposed plan turned out significantly different than the activity answers given by Prof Reid, you may want to note what was different. Then, write about how the plan you wrote in the break-down connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.


Write your Devlog here!
After we came back from winter break I forgot how to Institate objects and that was primarliy my problem with the project. I was rewriting my code multiples times in different ways seeing what would work and when I took a break from coding to refreshen my mind something ended up happening and I'm still unsure what happened that in VS I couldn't use Vector3 or Quaternion without adding UnityEngine when before I was able to write without out it and my game still worked. So because of that issue I erase all of my code under PlantSeed and just rewrote eveything again in a different way to see if it'll solve the issue. At first I decided not to create a new vector and instead tried to fit eveything together in Instasitate and I thought that would've worked but the  _plantPrefab never spawned into game so I went back to using a vector and it worked. I guess I did it wrong the first time but I was quite happy that it worked out. That was really the only issue I had with the homework other than that, everything we learned from 31 was helpful and the unity documentation because some of the things I forgot or didn't remeber fully was there.
