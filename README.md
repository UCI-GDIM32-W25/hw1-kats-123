## Devlog
After we came back from winter break I forgot how to Institate objects and that was primarliy my problem with the project. I was rewriting my code multiples times in different ways seeing what would work and when I took a break from coding to refreshen my mind something ended up happening and I'm still unsure what happened that in VS I couldn't use Vector3 or Quaternion without adding UnityEngine when before I was able to write without out it and my game still worked. So because of that issue I erase all of my code under PlantSeed and just rewrote eveything again in a different way to see if it'll solve the issue. At first I decided not to create a new vector and instead tried to fit eveything together in Instasitate and I thought that would've worked but the  _plantPrefab never spawned into game so I went back to using a vector and it worked. I guess I did it wrong the first time but I was quite happy that it worked out. That was really the only issue I had with the homework other than that, everything we learned from 31 was helpful and the unity documentation because some of the things I forgot or didn't remeber fully was there.

## Prof comments
I unfortunately cannot give this Devlog full credit because it does not answer the prompt. I think you wrote a Devlog in last quarter's style without reading the prompt, which asked you to connect the break-down to your code and to provide examples from the code. I'm giving you 1 point because you did describe your code accurately, but in the future, if your Devlog ignores the prompt, you'll get a 0 for it! Be careful with your Devlog for HW2. :)

Thank you for taking the time to fix your Devlog formatting! In the future, you can also remove the prompts (perhaps after you read them ;P - and they're always available on the assignment page on Canvas). This will make it a lot easier for me to read your Devlog.
